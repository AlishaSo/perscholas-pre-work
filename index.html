      <p>I'm Dominican-American, fluent in Spanish and have some knowledge of French, Portuguese and American Sign Language. I love learning (hence the languages ðŸ˜‚) and love zoning out to think about existential things like: are humans inherently good or bad? I'm always reading <em>something</em>, but my favorite genre is nonfiction &mdash; specifically memoirs. I am not a beginner at coding and in fact already have a portfolio page online; check that out <a href='https://www.alishasoriano.com/'>here</a>. That being said, if you're struggling with anything or just need a coding buddy, I'm always down to help. Feel free to reach out to me!
